# amazon_sql_project

## **Project Overview**

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of an amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behaviour, product performance, and sales trends using postgresSQL. Through this project, I have tackled various  SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problem using structured queries.

An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.

## **Database Setup & Design**

### **Schema Structure**
-- The database contain **8 tables**: 'customers','sellers','products','orders','order_items','inventory','payments' and 'shipping'.
-- These tables are designed with **primary keys**, **foreign key constraints**, and proper indexing to maintain data integrity and optimize query performance.
-- You can find the SQL script for setting up the database schema [here]

---

### **Constraints**
- Referential integrity is enforced using foreign keys.
- Default values and data types are applied where necessary to maintain consistency.
- Uniqueness is guaranteed for fields like 'product_id', 'order_id',  and 'customer_id'.

---

## **Task: Data Cleaning**

I cleaned dataset by:
- Removing duplicates: Duplicates in the customer and order tables were identified and removed.
- Handling misisng values: Null values in critical fields (e.g. customer address, payment status) were either filled with default values or handled using appropriate methods.

---

## **Identifying Business Problems**

Key business problems identified:
1. Top selling products: Top 10 products by total sales values

## **Solving Business Problems**

### Solution Implemented:
- **Restock Predictions**: By forecasting product demand based on past sales, I optimized restcoking cycles, minimizing stockouts.
- **Product Performance**: Indentified high-return and optimized their sales strategies, such as product bundling and pricing adjustments.
- **Shipping Optimization**: Analyzed shipping times and delivery providers to recommend better logistics strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Conducted RFM analysis to target marketing efforts towards "At-risk" customers, improving retention and loyalty.

---

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behaviour
- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- Forecasting and product performance

---

## ** Learning Outcomes**

This project enabled me:
- Design and implement a normalized database schema.
- Clean and pre process real-world datasets for analysis.
- Use advanced SQL techniques, including window functions, subqueries and joins.
- Conduct in-depth business analysis using SQL.
- Optimize query performance and handle large datasets efficiently.

---

## **Conclusion**

This advanced SQL project successfully demonstrates my ability to solve real-world e-commerce problem with structured queries. From improving retention to operational efficiency, this project provides valuable insights into operational challenges and solutions.

By completing this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of how SQL can be used to tackle complex data problems and derive business decision making.
